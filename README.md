%% PSO-LPQ Image Features - Created in 22 Jan 2022 by Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi
% This code extracts Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) features out of 100
% samples of images in 10 classes. LPQ features are in the family of frequency based features.
% Then desired number of PSO features
% will be selected out of extracted LPQ features which have highest
% impact. Actually, you can select n strongest features. Results show,
% however number of selected features goes down, but recognition accuracy
% is almost intact. 'nf' is number of selected features by PSO. Images are
% stores in 'data' folder.
